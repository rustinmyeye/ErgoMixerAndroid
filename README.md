# Ergo Mixer for Android
Ergo Mixer on Android. Will be the same setup as the Ergo Node for android, but with secure firewall settings so that the mixer is only availble to the device running it.

I would like to figure out how to access the Mixer dashboard from within the app, maybe with WebView in Android layout.

Id like to hide all parts of the command line...
